			<h2>Who Is He?</h2>
				<p id="who">Christian Chmielewski is a web designer from Jacksonville, Fl who is
				studying at FSCJ South Campus for Computer Programming, currently 
				working towards his Java Programming Certificate. Fluent with modern
				web applications like Microsoft Office, he's able to gather and display
				data efficiently and effectively throughout his projects. Particularly
				useful when considering his understanding of project management, which
				requires good planning and execution. Christian started his programming 
				journey learning the basics in pseudocode with his peers, and plans
				to continue his education, web development, and programming skills in
				in the future.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="now">
			<h2>Where Is He Now?</h2>
				<p id="now">Christian is still studying at FSCJ's South Campus and has no intentions
				to stop anytime soon. Currently, he is building an understanding for
				HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript alongside his SQL Server course. This website actually happens
				to be a project of his to demonstrate what his first month in the class
				has taught him. He is also taking an Information Systems course this
				semester (Fall 2022) which will help him better understand the software, 
				hardware, and services people use to manage information.</p>
		</div>
        <div id="going">
			<h2>Where Is He Going?</h2>
				<p id="going">Although Christian still has one semester left before he completes his
				first technical certificate, he has plans lined up to put all of his
				new found knowledge to use, and is ready for even more. During Spring
				of 2023, he plans to take courses in Advanced Java programming, and Developing enterprise
				Applications using Java EE. After completion, he plans to pursue a 
				career in programming, web development, or both, and continue his
				education in other programming languages such as Python, C, and C++.
				His vision is to write new programs that will one day change the world.
