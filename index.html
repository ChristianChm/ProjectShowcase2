<p class="intro">On this page I will display projects I am completing in my COP2822 class.
 All projects are examples of my work and none of the products are available 
 for purchase. It is my hope that both myself and others can look back at this 
demonstration and gain value in sharpening our skills by seeing what has been
presented well, and what could be done better. Finally, I will use FTP - 
FileZilla to publish to my school's hosting server and possibly another site
for free. Any changes made to this site will be listed on a seperate page</p>
